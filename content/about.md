# Hi there! This is about me.

&#x1F4A1;

Years ago, I had an idea that kept buzzing around my head. I wanted to create something, to start a new project, but I knew I wanted it to be something tech-related. It wasn't until a few months had passed that I stumbled upon a Python code and saw the vast world of possibilities that lay in creating algorithms. 

&#x1F4C8;

At the time, I was working in the corporate world, analyzing data, advising and advocating for businesses. But as soon as I realized the power of coding, I knew I wanted to combine the best of both worlds and become a data scientist. I was hooked, and I was determined to use machine learning to empower businesses and revolutionize the way we make decisions.

The world of technology is both enormous and captivating. From the Large Language Models that are currently changing the game to the countless innovations yet to come, there is always something new to learn and explore. And to be part of the team that creates these advancements is truly the dream.

&#x1F680;

Now, as a data scientist, I have the power to turn data into actionable insights, to guide businesses towards better decisions, and to make a real impact on the world. I never would have thought that my curiosity and passion for technology would lead me down this path, but I couldn't be happier with where it's taken me.
